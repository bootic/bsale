# Bsale Client

Basic, generic API client for the Bsale API at https://api.bsale.cl/v1

Hypermedia-based. Follow links in each resource instead of hard-coding URLs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bsale'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bsale

## Usage

```ruby
client = Bsale::Client.new('someaccesstoken')
products = client.get('products.json')
products.count # 4
products.limit # 25
products.to_h # full hash resource
products.items # [<Bsale::Entity...>, <Bsale::Entity ..>]
products.items.map(&:id) # [1,2,3, etc]
# follow hrefs, makes new GET request
product = products.items.follow
product.id #Â 1
new_product = client.post('products', name: 'new product')
r = client.delete(product.href)
r._status # 204
```

Check API docs to see what entry-point URLs are available.
